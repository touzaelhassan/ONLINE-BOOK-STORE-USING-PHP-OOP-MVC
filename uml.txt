    - Collect Requirements ( Identify the problems we want to solve )
     We need to build an online store web application where The admin can perform CRUD operations on ( categories, authors, publishers, books and users )
     and users can creats an acount and login to view all books and book details then add the prefered book to the shopping cart then pay using Paypal to
     get the book.

     * as an admin I can login to the dashboard to see the store statistics
     * as an admin I can perform CRUD operations on ( categories, publishers, authors, books and users)

     * as a user I want to acces the application to see all books and book details
     * as a user I want to create an account and login to The application to add books to my shooping cart
     * as a user I can pay using a payment method to get a book
     * as a user I can see my books
